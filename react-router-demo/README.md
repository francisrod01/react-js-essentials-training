## React Router ##

React Router is a complete routing library for React.

Components are the heart of React's powerful, declarative programming model. React Router is a collection of `navigational components` that compose declaratively with your application. Whether you want to have `bookmarkable URLs` for your web app or a composable way to navigate in `React Native`, React Router works wherever React is rendering--so take your pick!

### Concepts ###

The react-router is a tool that helps you ...

- `dynamically display the page we want to see`.

What type of HTML element is a Link component converted to?

- `<a> tag`

Why might you use router parameters?

- `to go to a different route based on a filter`
