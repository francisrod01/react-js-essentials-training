## React Router ##

[React Router][1] is a complete routing library for React.

Components are the heart of React's powerful, declarative programming model. React Router is a collection of `navigational components` that compose declaratively with your application. Whether you want to have `bookmarkable URLs` for your web app or a composable way to navigate in `React Native`, React Router works wherever React is rendering--so take your pick!

### Concepts about React Router ###

The react-router is a tool that helps you ...

- `dynamically display the page we want to see`.

What type of HTML element is a Link component converted to?

- `<a> tag`

Why might you use router parameters?

- `to go to a different route based on a filter`

## State and Lifecycle ##

In applications with many components, itâ€™s very important to free up resources taken by the components when they are destroyed.

- `componentWillMount`
- `componentDidMount`
- `componentWillUnmount`
- `componentWillReceiveProps`
- `shouldComponentUpdate`
- `componentWillUpdate`
- `render`
- `componentDidUpdate`

### Concepts about Lifecycle ###

Component lifecycle methods can be used in createClass and ES6 Class components.

- TRUE

Why might you use shouldComponentUpdate?

- `to avoid rendering when it's unnecessary`
